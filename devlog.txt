While I'm at the pavillion, I'm eating some school dinner with my girlfriend when I get a call from my friend asking
to bring him some grub since its closing soon. I agree and start to deliver a box of chicken nuggets to my friend's
dorm. To my surprise I enter his room to see him coding, I ask him if he's finally working on the coding lab's we were
given for class. He laughs and tells me no, and that its the prework for an internship he is applying to. I tell him
that's cool and that he should link me that internship because it looks like something that would interest me. He links
it to me and I get to work. It took me around an hour to get the basics of the web app done: title, buttons, game logic,
and stylings. And that brings me to now.

I have things planned, in addition to the optional tasks given by CodePath:
- scoreboard
- endless mode
- more buttons
- scores
- difficulties

I will check into this devlog every hour to track how long I've spent, and my creative process.

So far all I've done is give the game a unique name, description, and a footer giving my information.

I kinda got distracted with a bunch of Elden Ring lore stuff and watching too much Pyrocynical. But I did add some stuff
that I'm really proud of. Now I'm not sure if I should commit some stuff to github already because I want some items to
be implemented before I record the videos. Basically, I added another button, and I've made it so that keyboard presses
count toward guesses. I was going to write a but statement there, but while writing it I figured out a fix for it.

So I lied when I said I was going to bed

Hours spent on project: I'mma say around 3 by now, I'm not counting 2 of the hours since starting since I was literally
dicking around on YouTube and shit. My roommate is literally grinding Metal Gear Rising with an autoclicker I think..?
But I've implemented a three strikes system.

This whole speed up the clues the further you go along is complete and utter bollocks. It's very hard, I'm writting it
down so I can remember my frustration when I'm doing my reflection on this project. Good lord did I not read the
instruction when it gave me the easiest way to solve my problem.

Stopping here, I'm pretty much sure I'm done with everything I want to do the requirements.
